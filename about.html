        <div class="AboutTextRight">
        <p>
            I am a computer science student at Queensborough Community College.
            There is so much I want to do with this degree; especially with my
            interests I'm passionate about: animation, storytelling, the environment,
            and many other global issues! I aspire to make an impact through all my 
            passions, whether it's creating a game, website, app, animation or illustration.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not learning something new, I am exploring new places, foods, and hobbies!
        </p>
